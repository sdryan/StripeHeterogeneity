# StripeHeterogeniety
Supplemental Codes and Movie Files for Paper "Better Together: Modeling the Effect of Spatial Heterogeneity on Synthetic Microbial Consortia Dynamics"

 
P1N1_Synchronization_Test_Code: Implements synchronization test for the P1N1 consortium and allows for the changing of the basal production rate Î·a0 through changing the basal multiplier value.
 
P2N1_Synchronization_Test_Code: Implements synchronization test for the P2N1 consortium.
 
P2N1_Synchronization_Test_Width: Implements test for the P2N1 consortium but allows for the changing of the number of stripes in the consortium.
 
P2N1_Heterogeneity_Small_Big: Implements the synchronization test for the heterogeneous stripes case.
